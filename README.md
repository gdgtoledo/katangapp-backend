This is your new Play application
=================================

This file will be packaged with your application, when using `activator dist`.

# Contributing
In order to contribute to the project, please fork the repository, add the
functionality you want, or fix any bug you like, and send a pull request to the
main repository, which is hosted here:[https://bitbucket.org/craftsmanshiptoledo/katangapp-backend](https://bitbucket.org/craftsmanshiptoledo/katangapp-backend).

Our team will work on its review and try to merge it into the `dev` branch. For
that reason, **always send the pull requests to the dev branch**, which is the
development branch for this purpose.

The `master` branch is a frozen branch, only updated with releases of the
project.

# Workspace set-up
First of all, you need to install `Play! Framework` into your machine. It is
pretty well documented in their website, so please visit it for more info:
[https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/Installing](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/Installing)

As the project is based on `Play! Framework`, you should install a plugin in
your IDE. Whether you use Eclipse or IntelliJ, there are plugins that support
it. Please visit this page for more info:
[https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/IDE](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/IDE)

Then, import the project into your IDE, and voilà!

# Running the application
To run the application, browse your workspace to project's folder, open a shell
and type:
``
activator run
``
It will open a port in your local machine (default is 9000), where you could
test the application: open a browser and go to `http://localhost:9000`. It
should display the default `Play! Framework` main page.

To verify the business logic of the application, go to
`http://localhost:9000/paradas`, that represents the endpoint of the service
that calculates the closest bus stops to a specific point. It needs the
following parameters to work:

 - lt: Latitude of a location (Double)
 - ln: Longitude of a location (Double)
 - r: Radius to use when searching for the closest bus stops (Integer)

In example: `http://localhost:9000/paradas?lt=39.862658&ln=-4.025088&r=500`

## Available Stores
The application offers two endpoints to retrieve the data it uses, in JSON
format, one for the bus routes, describing each route and its bus stops, and
the other for the bus stops, describing each bus stop. The endpoints are:

Routes endpoint:
```
http://localhost:9000/routes
```

Bus Stops endpoint:
```
http://localhost:9000/busStops
```

## Backward compatibility
To verify that the former system' business logic is working as expected, go to
`http://localhost:9000/unauto`, that represents the endpoint of the former
system. It needs the following parameters to work:

 - idl: Route identifier (String)
 - idp: Bus Stop identifier (String)
 - ido: Bus Stop Order (String)

In example: `http://localhost:9000/unauto?idl=41&idp=P001&ido=1.00000`
